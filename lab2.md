###Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
First of all a valid license is required for a software to be considered as open source.
Also depending on the situation, different licenses may come in handy.
While all the open source licenses guarentees certain freedom, 
in terms of distribution of code certain restrictions may apply.
The copyleft licenses requires all distributed work to be the same license while
permissive lecenses such as the MIT License don't have such restrictions.

###Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
A project without an explicit license indicate that it is not truely open source.
So, all the freedoms of open sources project doesn't apply in this instance.
The permission of the owner is required prior to using the code in order prevent
potential legal issues.

###Why the Web beat Gopher
I disagree with the claim that the developers should release their software to the public early.
There is no guarentee that the open source approach would be better in every situation.
Also, there should be no obligation to participate in the open source community.
If the developer just want to work on the projects themselves, they should be entitled
to do that. They have decided to take on the risk themselves and the result simply didn't work out.


###Justify license
The GPL v2 license was choosen for linux because it is a copyleft license which
ensures that any modifications distributed would remain open source.
This ensures that linux would remain as a open source project no matter what
and it still would be free to use for anyone. This way the developers could be
sure that any work they do will benefit the users and the community instead of
some one that just exploits the community without giving back to it.

###Example project
A small game of tic tac toe - GPL license

###Which license better	
	For developers - GPL license would be better because it ensures that
whatever the developers worked on would remain in the community and benefit
the users. Anything they've written can't be taken advantage of this way.
	For company - Apache/BSD license would be better because it contain a 
patent license which may be in the interest of certain corporations.
	For common good - LGPL license would be better because it not restrictive in
any application that uses the code. Since the license mainly applies to libraries
its code can be used in many different ways and all without restriction. Since it provides
a greater amount of freedom than GPL and doesn't have a patent attached, it is
better for the common good.

###Choosing project to work
I want to work on a puzzle game that can be played single player and potentially have
local multiplayer. The details of the game aren't exactly clear, it could be remake
of a pre-existing game or a brand new concept if I can come up with one. The users of
this project will be fans of puzzle games or just some one interested in playing indie
games. I will probably choose the MIT license for this project because it is permissive so
people can do whatever they want with the code. Since the project is most likely very small,
It doesn't really need too much restrictions on it.
