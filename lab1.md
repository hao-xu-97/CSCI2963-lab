###Free Culture
I feel that the situation described is very absurd for the student.
There was no protection for the people who worked those search engines and they
were easily targeted by larger organization. I feel there should be some sort of 
system that offers that kind of protection to individuals that manages those database
that might potentially contain illegal data. After all those students were only working
voluntarily and their works are beneficial to the community. To blame the programmers
for the illegal activity of users is rather illogical. The justice system should
protect the innocent and not favor large organizations. There should be some sort
of incentive for programmers to who do go for the community. At the very least
protection should be offered. The creater of a software shouldnt be held
accountable for how the software is used by end users.
