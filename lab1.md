###Smart Questions
How to answer questions in a helpful way
* show where to find extra help
* provide extra information that will possibly answer future questions that might arise

###Free Culture
I feel that the situation described is very absurd for the student.
There was no protection for the people who worked those search engines and they
were easily targeted by larger organization. I feel there should be some sort of 
system that offers that kind of protection to individuals that manages those database
that might potentially contain illegal data. After all those students were only working
voluntarily and their works are beneficial to the community. To blame the programmers
for the illegal activity of users is rather illogical. The justice system should
protect the innocent and not favor large organizations. There should be some sort
of incentive for programmers to who do go for the community. At the very least
protection should be offered. The creater of a software shouldnt be held
accountable for how the software is used by end users.

###Reflection
I am interested in creating a puzzle game. The mechanics of the game
will probably be based on math, physics, logic, or a combination of those.
I've always been a fan of puzzle games although never have created one myself.
A lot of the puzzle games out there could be very obvious or insanely complex.
So it would be a challenge to create a game that would have just the right
difficulty that the player will find satisfying to solve but not frustrating
in the process. Depending of the amount of potential calculations and graphical
features, I might use a game engine for development as it is optimized for
creating extensive games.
